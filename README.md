# Tiny WASM, Army of One
<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06d7b9d7-2e20-4d00-a512-a6b1ca95bcd2" />

## Intro — The Pitch

Spin up **tiny, sandboxed WASM apps** that scale to millions, run in **sub-second time**, and cut infra spend by **~90%**. No armies of SREs, no sprawling microservices—just **an army of one** armed with Rust, Fast-CGI, and edge-native AI.

* **WASM-first**: secure, portable, cold-start-proof.
* **Rust-powered**: predictable performance, zero-cost abstractions.
* **Fast-CGI at the edge**: lightning I/O with minimal overhead.
* **AI-driven ops**: autoscale, route, and tune with fine-tuned engines.
* **Distributed & embedded**: drop into routers, kiosks, sidecars, or CDNs.
* **Economical by design**: pay for micro-milliseconds, not idle VMs.

**Use it as a framework. Use it as an experiment. Use it as a sales accelerator.**
Prototype in minutes, demo in hours, deploy the same day. Gotta love it.

> **Now shipping:** WASM-driven Fast-CGI, Rust services, edge server adapters, AI + fine-tuned inference hooks.
> **Coming next:** observability stubs, policy guards, blue/green rollouts, one-click demos.

## Conclusion — Why This Wins

This repo is about **outcomes**: faster pages, safer runtimes, and **dramatically lower TCO**—without sacrificing developer joy. You get a **repeatable playbook** for pitching and proving modern distributed apps that **sell themselves** with real speed and real savings.

* **Show, don’t tell**: sub-second endpoints speak louder than slide decks.
* **Scale without fear**: WASM sandboxes keep blast radius tiny.
* **Automate the boring**: let AI steer tuning, routing, and ops hygiene.
* **Ship as one**: tools that once needed a team now fit your solo workflow.

**Clone. Run. Demo.** We’ll add the tooling as we go—benchmarks, templates, deploy buttons, and sales one-pagers. Until then, this is your **edge-native, AI-assisted WASM kit** for turning prospects into pilots and pilots into production.

**Ready?** Make something fast, cheap, and undeniable.
