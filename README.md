# Tiny WASM, Army of One
<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06d7b9d7-2e20-4d00-a512-a6b1ca95bcd2" />

## Intro — The Pitch

Spin up **tiny, sandboxed WASM apps** that scale to millions, run in **sub-second time**, and cut infra spend by **~90%**. No armies of SREs, no sprawling microservices—just **an army of one** armed with Rust, Fast-CGI, and edge-native AI.

* **WASM-first**: secure, portable, cold-start-proof.
* **Rust-powered**: predictable performance, zero-cost abstractions.
* **Fast-CGI at the edge**: lightning I/O with minimal overhead.
* **AI-driven ops**: autoscale, route, and tune with fine-tuned engines.
* **Distributed & embedded**: drop into routers, kiosks, sidecars, or CDNs.
* **Economical by design**: pay for micro-milliseconds, not idle VMs.

**Use it as a framework. Use it as an experiment. Use it as a sales accelerator.**
Prototype in minutes, demo in hours, deploy the same day. Gotta love it.

> **Now shipping:** WASM-driven Fast-CGI, Rust services, edge server adapters, AI + fine-tuned inference hooks.
> **Coming next:** observability stubs, policy guards, blue/green rollouts, one-click demos.

## Conclusion — Why This Wins

This repo is about **outcomes**: faster pages, safer runtimes, and **dramatically lower TCO**—without sacrificing developer joy. You get a **repeatable playbook** for pitching and proving modern distributed apps that **sell themselves** with real speed and real savings.

* **Show, don’t tell**: sub-second endpoints speak louder than slide decks.
* **Scale without fear**: WASM sandboxes keep blast radius tiny.
* **Automate the boring**: let AI steer tuning, routing, and ops hygiene.
* **Ship as one**: tools that once needed a team now fit your solo workflow.

**Clone. Run. Demo.** We’ll add the tooling as we go—benchmarks, templates, deploy buttons, and sales one-pagers. Until then, this is your **edge-native, AI-assisted WASM kit** for turning prospects into pilots and pilots into production.

**Ready?** Make something fast, cheap, and undeniable.

# Fly Paper Fly.io

In the cloudbound city of Fly, apps are born inside Firecracker thimbles—tiny ironclad microVMs lit with dragonfire. Each thimble is its own keep: walls of hardware magic keep travelers separate, so no sorcery bleeds between rooms. Smiths allot a whole hammer to a single thimble—one core per craft—so no forge steals another’s strike. These keeps perch on hulking sky-beasts with 8–32 hearts and 32–256 goblets of memory, and yet each thimble feels alone and safe.

Across the realm, heralds shout one name from every tower at once—BGP Anycast—so calls find the nearest door without thinking. At each door stands a Rust-forged sentinel, the fly-proxy, who greets the caller, checks their sigil, and—if asked—lifts the TLS veil with a courteous nod. Then, with a stamp of its seal, the sentinel opens a secret way.

For beneath the cobbles runs WireGuard: a lattice of moonlit tunnels binding distant cities. If a traveler hails in Dallas but the rightful keep sits in Chicago, the sentinel ushers them below, where the tunnels run swift and near-frictionless, and they arrive without the weariness of long roads.

Thus the city hums: tiny keeps, mighty beasts, heralded names, courteous sentinels, and silent tunnels—each piece simple, together enchanted—so your work can fly.

# Cargo Cult (but it’s not witchcraft) - it's RUST

<img width="559" height="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69bd057a-aa7e-4077-a0ab-6abf5a4937ff" />

They called it a cult because the newcomers kept smiling at compiler errors. But the truth was simpler: Rust just had rules that worked.

Cargo rolled in like a clean supply chain—cargo new, cargo check, cargo run—containers sealed, provenance clear. Crates snapped together with semver discipline; features toggled like precise circuit breakers. Ownership wasn’t mysticism, it was logistics: who holds the box, who hands it off, when the pallet gets recycled. Lifetimes were shipping labels, not spells—so nothing got lost in transit.

Traits gave interfaces a steel frame. Enums mapped the state space so there were no trapdoors, only documented branches. Pattern matching turned edge cases into checklists. And when threads spun up, Send + Sync signed the safety forms before anything moved. No runtime janitor, no GC chase—just zero-cost abstractions that read like poetry and run like C.

The borrow checker was a tough foreman, sure, but fair: “Prove it’s safe, and we go faster.” Prove it, and release mode sings—LLVM polishing the last microns off the parts, async tasks flowing like a well-tuned conveyor.

By dusk, the build light turns green, and everyone nods—not a miracle, just engineering that keeps its promises. Rust doesn’t ask for faith. It hands you a manifest, a checklist, and the keys. Gotta love it.

They called it “enterprise,” but it moved like a barnacled barge. Java sprawled; inheritance begat interfaces begat meetings. Beneath, a Giant Application Server—XML-eating, WAR-munching—snored in stack traces. Deploys required priests and scrolls. After three sprints and a retrospective souvenir, the homepage finally whispered:

# Quickdrawl - FastCGI

<img width="559" height="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29b32cc3-285d-41d3-9b20-3ea779091208" />

Hello, World.

Cheer. Hotfix. Snore.

Then a breeze: a tiny process in a shell-cape. “Fast-CGI,” it said. Ancient? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely. No container waltz—just socket, fork, reply. Up before a latte blinks; gone when idle. CPU dipped in thanks. Memory so small it made your mother blush and your CFO misty.

“Where’s the framework?” the dragon yawned.
“I am the framework,” said Fast-CGI, writing “Hello, World” so clean it squeaked.

No cache myths, no ORMs singing sonnets—just a page, alive, in milliseconds. Jenkins tried to wrap a WAR around it, found nothing to hug, retired to a farm upstate.

Sparks multiplied: a constellation of tiny, ephemeral workers. Logs became haiku: accepted, answered, gone. The dragon curled into history; velocity sounded like wind through cables. The roadmap fit on a postcard: Ship daily.

They didn’t demolish the cathedral; they outgrew it. Fast-CGI kept the port open, smiling its non-smile.

Modern is whatever says hello before you finish saying world.

Multitenancy lets one platform serve many customers without feeling “shared.” You get lower cost and faster upgrades, but only if each tenant’s data and performance stay isolated—no noisy neighbors, no cross-tenant peeking. Isolation isn’t a bolt-on; it’s the product.

WASM helps a lot: memory-safe bytecode, default-deny capabilities (no file/network access unless granted), and fast cold starts so you can spin a fresh sandbox per request or per tenant. Same module, same behavior across hosts makes testing and auditing simpler.

But no sandbox is “unbreakable.” Bugs in runtimes, side channels, bad app logic, or over-broad capabilities can still bite. Treat WASM as a strong inner wall, then add defense-in-depth: run as a low-priv user, lock down WASI imports, enforce CPU/mem/time and egress allow-lists, sign modules, and—when assurance matters—wrap it all in containers or microVMs.
